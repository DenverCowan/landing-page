# landing-page

This is my take on the landing page project from
The Odin Project foundations course.
This project should demonstrate proficiency in
HTML & CSS. especially Flexbox.

- I decided to model a page for a local business so that it would be more original and realistic than being given exact fonts and colors.

- Skills learned:
  -Importing google fonts
  -Resetting default browser box-sizing, margin, and padding.
  -How to create and style a button.
