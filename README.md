# landing-page

This is my take on the landing page project from
The Odin Project foundations course.
This project should demonstrate proficiency in
HTML & CSS. especially Flexbox.

- I decided to model a page for a local business so that it would be more original and realistic than being given exact fonts and colors. Although initially to save time I did use many of the given colors and fonts.

- Skills learned:
  - Importing google fonts.
  - Resetting default browser box-sizing, margin, and padding.
  - How to create and style a button.
  - how to nest HTML elements to target them with flexbox.
